Hello, <br>
Welcome to Fontly.<br>
Now ease your workflow by using fontly for "pixel" to "vw" conversions
Forget using Calculator for every conversion.

<h3>Core features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enter a font size(without "px") in the main input box to convert it into vw (viewport width) format.</li>
  <li>As you enter a valid pixel value in the input box, font sizes are generated as per default breakpoints in the Generated Font size section</li>
  <li>Add custom breakpoints as per your project in the "Add Custom breakpoint" section.</li>
  <li>Enter a valid breakpoint pixel value in the given input box.</li>
  <li>Click the button "Add new Breakpoint", to push the entered breakpoint to the "Generated Font Size" section.</li>
</ul>

Feel free to download the zip file from github and use it for your next responsive web developement project.
- You may edit the default breakpoint values by going to fontly/js/app.js file and edit the breakpoints array to the values relevant to your project.

Let me know if you have any new ideas or suggestions for the project.

Thank you for using Fontly.

Regards,
Ashish Tewari
